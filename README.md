# Long Storage Tanks
When playing Factorio with Logistic Train Network enabled, I never liked the micro management of balancing fluids for each tank in a train station. 

This mod adds larger storage tanks (with configurable sizes) to simplify building better, simpler train stations.
Tanks have enough connections on either side to allow 3 pumps per wagon

**Note:** I would suggest to limit yourself to a size of 12 wagons at most for balancing reasons
